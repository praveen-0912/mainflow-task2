                <h3>YAMAHA</h3>
                <p>Yamaha is the second Japanese motorcycle brand on our list. The Yamaha motorcycle factory branched off from the world’s largest piano manufacturer. Its origin is still carried in the Yamaha logo – the three intersecting tuning forks. If you ask us, that just adds to the poetry of riding!</p>

                <h3>Suzuki</h3>
                <p>Suzuki sports bikes are the motorcycle brands’ secret weapon. While globally sport bikes don’t account for much of the motorcycle market, one in four Suzukis sold is a sports bike. The Suzuki GSX-R, colloquially referred to as a “jixxer”, comes in different displacements. All of them are well-loved by motorcycle enthusiasts. Suzuki also sells one of the fastest off-the-shelve two-wheelers, the GSX1300R Hayabusa.</p>

                <h3>Kawasaki</h3>
                <p>Kawasaki started off as an aircraft manufacturer. Because of this, some of their early motorcycles display an emblem with “Kawasaki Aircraft” on the fuel tank. Imagine how cool it would be if it actually took off!</p>
